The Extracted TIPS folder contains the tips extracted from the venues of foursquare.com site
The Recursive1 folder contains the actual scrapy project files using which the tips are extracted
The Spiders folder contains the crawl spiders used to extract the tips from venues
We begin by modeling the item that we will use to hold the sites data obtained from foursquare.com, as we want to capture the tipText, username, tipDate, we define fields for each of these three attributes. To do that, we edit items.py. The returned json file contains these fields.
